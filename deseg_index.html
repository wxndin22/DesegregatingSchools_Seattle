    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This project examines the relationship between racial diversity in public schools and neighborhood rent prices in two urban areas: Seattle, Washington and Charlotte, North Carolina. Using a combination of public enrollment data, GIS Shapefiles, census tract data, and rental information, we created visualizations to analyze patterns of segregation and housing affordability at the neighborhood level. In particular, we map school diversity levels and surrounding rental costs to investigate spatial patterns and disparities. Both cities have complex histories with desegregation efforts: Charlotte is well-known for its 1970s busing initiatives that temporarily achieved national prominence as a success story of school integration, while Seattle pursued voluntary integration efforts in the same era, later facing legal and demographic challenges. In recent decades, both cities have experienced significant gentrification, raising concerns about re-segregation along racial and economic lines. Our project uses geospatial and statistical methods to create visualizations and summary statistics that explore these dynamics. Key findings include observable disparities in diversity and rent levels across neighborhoods, and correlations between racial composition and economic variables. They suggest that schools in higher-rent neighborhoods tend to have different racial compositions than those in lower-rent areas, highlighting persistent inequities. By comparing Seattle and Charlotte, we seek to better understand how historic and current housing patterns continue to shape educational access and diversity today.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Urban school systems in the United States have been long shaped by patterns of racial segregation and economic inequality. This project investigates how racial diversity in public schools relates to neighborhood rent prices in Seattle, Washington and Charlotte, North Carolina—two cities with distinct but comparable histories of integration efforts and subsequent gentrification. Our study aims to visualize and analyze whether school-level diversity correlates with local housing affordability, and how spatial patterns reveal the ongoing legacies of segregation.</p>
    <p>Charlotte gained national attention in the 1970s as a model for successful school desegregation following the landmark Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education decision, which led to widespread busing to promote racial integration. However, court orders ended in the 1990s, and since then, Charlotte has witnessed significant resegregation alongside rapid urban development and housing displacement. Similarly, Seattle implemented voluntary integration programs beginning in the late 20th century, but has since grappled with persistent disparities and demographic shifts fueled by rising housing costs.</p>
    <p>Both cities are now experiencing profound gentrification, raising questions about how neighborhood changes affect school demographics. Our project focuses on two key research questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How does racial diversity in public schools vary in relation to neighborhood rent levels?</li>
      <li>Are there spatial patterns of school segregation that correspond with economic changes in the surrounding areas?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By linking public school enrollment data, geographic shapefiles, and census tract rent data, we aim to create maps, scatterplots, and statistical summaries that illuminate these patterns. Our goal is to deepen understanding of how educational and housing inequalities are interconnected, and how urban transformation continues to impact opportunities for students of color.</p>
