  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>[Clearly state your research question(s) and discuss the context in some detail]</p>
  </section>

  <section id="methods">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>[including detailed information about your data:
        Sources of the datasets used, including links to the original sources. Details of particular variables/measures/metrics used. How data was collected (by those who originally collected it...not just where you got it from).
        Did it involve random sampling? Experiments? Is the data in some sense "representative" of some broader population? 
        Data collection methods have important ramifications for what you can actually conclude from the data.
        How data from multiple sources was combined (by you),
        Details of new variables/metrics that you created.
        How/why did you create them?
        Brief discussion of key statistical methods used in your analysis]</p>
  </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>[Details of your key analyses:
        Summary tables and data visualizations as appropriate.
        Results of statistical analyses.
        Discussion of the results in this section should be very factual, grounded directly in the data; limit/avoid interpretation that goes beyond the direct conclusions from the analysis (further discussion/interpretation occurs in the final "Discussion" section).
        Include subheadings to clearly organize your results]</p>
