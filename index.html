    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This project examines the relationship between racial diversity in public schools and neighborhood rent prices in two urban areas: Seattle, Washington and Charlotte, North Carolina. Inspired by the Urban Institute's analysis of Charlotte, NC, we replicated and extended their approach using newly sourced data for Seattle. Our primary objective was to determine whether the racial composition of public schools reflects the racial demographics of their surrounding neighborhoods, and how this relationship has evolved over time in both cities. Using a combination of public enrollment data, GIS Shapefiles, census tract data, and rental information, we created visualizations to analyze patterns of segregation and housing affordability at the neighborhood level. In particular, we map school diversity levels and surrounding rental costs to investigate spatial patterns and disparities. Both cities have complex histories with desegregation efforts: Charlotte is well-known for its 1970s busing initiatives that temporarily achieved national prominence as a success story of school integration, while Seattle pursued voluntary integration efforts in the same era, later facing legal and demographic challenges. In recent decades, both cities have experienced significant gentrification, raising concerns about re-segregation along racial and economic lines. Our project uses geospatial and statistical methods to create visualizations and summary statistics that explore these dynamics. Key findings include observable disparities in diversity and rent levels across neighborhoods, and correlations between racial composition and economic variables. They suggest that schools in higher-rent neighborhoods tend to have different racial compositions than those in lower-rent areas, highlighting persistent inequities. By comparing Seattle and Charlotte, we seek to better understand how historic and current housing patterns continue to shape educational access and diversity today.</p>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Urban school systems in the United States have been long shaped by patterns of racial segregation and economic inequality. This project investigates how racial diversity in public schools relates to neighborhood rent prices in Seattle, Washington and Charlotte, North Carolina—two cities with distinct but comparable histories of integration efforts and subsequent gentrification. Our study aims to visualize and analyze whether school-level diversity correlates with local housing affordability, and how spatial patterns reveal the ongoing legacies of segregation.</p>
    <p>Charlotte gained national attention in the 1970s as a model for successful school desegregation following the landmark Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education decision, which led to widespread busing to promote racial integration. However, court orders ended in the 1990s, and since then, Charlotte has witnessed significant resegregation alongside rapid urban development and housing displacement. Similarly, Seattle implemented voluntary integration programs beginning in the late 20th century, but has since grappled with persistent disparities and demographic shifts fueled by rising housing costs.</p>
    <p>Both cities are now experiencing profound gentrification, raising questions about how neighborhood changes affect school demographics. Our project focuses on two key research questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How does racial diversity in public schools vary in relation to neighborhood rent levels?</li>
      <li>Are there spatial patterns of school segregation that correspond with economic changes in the surrounding areas?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By linking public school enrollment data, geographic shapefiles, and census tract rent data, we aim to create maps, scatterplots, and statistical summaries that illuminate these patterns. Our goal is to deepen understanding of how educational and housing inequalities are interconnected, and how urban transformation continues to impact opportunities for students of color.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    Our analysis required the integration and harmonization of disparate datasets for Seattle, WA, to mirror the educational and housing equity analysis originally conducted for Charlotte, NC. Unlike Charlotte, which had a comprehensive pre-packaged dataset, Seattle required data collection from multiple decentralized sources. Our first challenge was locating equivalent variables across systems. We retrieved enrollment and demographic data for public schools in Washington State from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) and [data.wa.gov], which provided breakdowns by school, district, race/ethnicity, gender, and program participagion (e.g. ELL, IEPs).</p>

    We reviewed the original Charlotte visualizations to reverse-engineer the necessary variables and began cleaning and restructuring the Seattle datasets accordingly. Initial cleaning errors - such as misaligned variables and formatting inconsistencies - were corrected to ensure comparability. The Charlotte data was structured with tract-level and school-level components (including socioeconomic indicators, racial demographics, housing information, and school characteristics), drawn from Urban Institute's Education Data Portal and U.S. Census data via the tigris package.</p>

    For Seattle, we acquired school boundary shapefiles from Seattle Public Schools and additional demographic and housing datasets from King COunty and the American Community Survey (ACS 5-Year Estimates). We sourced median rent data from Seattle GIS via ArcGIS Open Data. However, aligning datasets posed multiple technical challenges: school demographic data lacked geographic coordinates, while rent data was neighborhood-based with inconsistent naming conventions. To resolve this, we geocoded school locations and standardized neighborhood names by cleaning, tokenizing, and lowercasing them. We filtered enrollment data to include only relevant rows from the Seattle School District No. 1. We retained entries for "All Grades," excluded aggregate rows (e.g., "District Total"), and specialized programs not tied to specific neighborhoods. We standarized school names by trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase to ensure consistency across datasets. We also manually renamed specific schools (e.g., "Edmonds S. Meany Middle School" to "Meany") to improve fuzzy matching.</p>

    Fuzzy joins were central to our merging process, particularly where identifiers were inconsistent. Using regex_left_join() and name matching via slice(1), we resolved mismatches between school names and demographic data. We performed spatial joins in R to attach census tract GEOIDs to each Seattle school, allowing us to layer school-level data over tract-level demographic indicators. This spatial linkage enabled the comparison of school composition with surrounding neighborhood characteristics such as race, income, housing cost burden, and poverty rates.</p>

    To visualize these relationships, we used R's spatial plotting tools, incorporating shapefiles and tract data for both cities. Challenges with dual-layer mapping were addressed using the ggnewscale package, which allowed for multiple color scales in the same plot. We used binned scales (10 evenly distributed bins) for consistency across visualizations and ensured accessibility through improved color palettes and map interactivity via Shiny.</p>

    For statistical analysis, we employed linear regression to test the association between tract-level and school-level racial compositions in Charlotte. We found statistically significant relationships (p < 0.0001) between the percentage of people of color living in a tract and the percentage of students of color attending schools in those same tracts. When disaggregated by race/ethnicity (e.g. % Black Residents vs % Black Students), all correlations remained significant. These results suggest demographic alignment between neighborhood populations and school enrollment patterns.</p>

    Overall, our methods combined data engineering, spatial analytics, and statistical modeling to draw meaningful comparisons between housing and education equity in Seattle and Charlotte. The diverse data landscape for Seattle required extensive preparation, cleaning, and validation to ensure replicability of the original Urban Institute methodology.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <h3>Seattle Public Schools: Diversity Distribution</h3>

    <h3>Seattle Rent vs. School Diversity</h3>
    
    <ul>The scatterplots reveal a notable correlation between the percentage of students of color in Seattle public schools and the median rent prices of their corresponding neighborhoods. Specifically, schools located in higher-rent areas tend to have a lower percentage of students of color, while those in lower-rent neighborhoods have a higher percentage. This suggests that economic factors, such as housing affordability, play a significant role in the racial composition of schools.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Charlotte Mapping Results</h3>
<h4>Residents of Color Map</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Higher concentrations of residents of color found in specific clusters, often corresponding with areas of public housing.</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Median Rent Map</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Some overlap between lower-rent areas and schools with higher percentages of students of color.</li>
    <li>This suggests a spatial correlation between economic status and school demographics.</li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Public Housing Distribution</h4>
      <li>Public housing tends to be located near schools with higher diversity, reinforcing spatial segregation.</li>
<h4>Charlotte vs. Seattle</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Both cities show that neighborhood characteristics significantly affect school demographics.
      <li>Charlotte’s historic busing programs may have delayed resegregation compared to Seattle’s more fragmented efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Correlation with Housing Costs</h4>
<ul>
    <ul>Similar to Seattle, there is a discernible relationship between neighborhood rent prices and school demographics in Charlotte. Schools in higher-rent areas tend to have a lower percentage of students of color, whereas those in more affordable neighborhoods have higher percentages. This pattern reflects the broader socioeconomic divides within the city.</em></ul>
</ul>
    
<h4>Spatial Patterns of Segregation</h4>
<ul>  
  <li>The maps illustrate that schools with higher percentages of students of color are concentrated in specific areas, often correlating with historically marginalized neighborhoods. This spatial segregation is indicative of enduring systemic inequalities and the lasting impact of historical policies on present-day educational landscapes.</em></li>
</ul>

    <h3>Seattle Mapping Results</h3>
 <ul>
      <li>Seattle schools show a broad range of diversity levels.
      <li>Many schools in the north (higher-income areas) have predominantly white student bodies.</li>
      <li>Schools in the south (such as Rainier Valley) show greater diversity and higher proportions of students of color.</li>
 </ul>
    
 <h4>School Diversity vs. Neighborhood Rent</h4>
  <ul>  
      <li>A negative correlation is evident: as neighborhood rent increases, the percentage of students of color tends to decrease.</li>
      <li>Schools in high-rent tracts (e.g., Capitol Hill, Queen Anne) tend to be less diverse.</li>
  </ul>
    
 <h4>Geographic Maps</h4>
 <ul>
      <li>Tracts in North Seattle: higher median rents, fewer residents of color.</li>
      <li>South Seattle: more residents of color, lower median rents.</li>
      <li>School diversity maps reflect these trends, suggesting a connection between housing affordability and school demographics.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Spatial Distribution of Diversity</h4>
 <ul>
      <li>The maps indicate that schools with higher percentages of students of color are predominantly situated in the southern regions of Seattle, such as Rainier Valley and Beacon Hill. Conversely, northern neighborhoods like Ballard and Queen Anne, which have higher rent prices, host schools with a lower percentage of students of color. This spatial pattern underscores the impact of housing costs on school demographics.</li>
     
<h4>Comparison with Neighborhood Demographics</h4>
<ul>
<li>When comparing school demographics to the racial composition of their surrounding census tracts, there is a general alignment, suggesting that schools reflect their immediate neighborhoods. However, some discrepancies exist, indicating potential factors such as school choice policies or district zoning that may influence enrollment patterns beyond residential proximity.</li>
</ul>
